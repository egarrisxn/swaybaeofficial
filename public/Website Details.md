**It’s Subathon Season\!** 

**Sway’s annual Subathon** is taking place from **December 23rd, 2024 until January 1st, 2025** on her Twitch Channel. Prepare for 10 straight days of fun, unbridled chaos to end the year with the Bae Squad\! Keep on reading for all the details:  
**(insert some responsive graphic here that fills up as more points are accrued)**  
**Also a visual representation of last goal accomplished and next goal, as well as how many points remaining until next goal**

The goals below can be accomplished with POINTS\! Here is the point system:

| 1 bit | 1 point |
| :---- | :---- |
| $1 tip | 100 points |
| Prime Sub | 400 points |

|  |  | Additional points for new multi-month subscription\* |  |  |  | Extra Points for Gifted Subs from Twitch (per Sub)\*\* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  |  | 3 month | 6 month | 12 month |  |  |
| Tier 1 Sub | 600 points | \+300 points | \+700 points | \+1500 points |  | \+100 points |
| Tier 2 Sub | 1000 points | \+600 points | \+1400 points | \+3000 points |  | \+200 points |
| Tier 3 Sub | 2500 points | \+1500 points | \+3500 points | \+7500 points |  | \+500 points |

\* Twitch is offering the following promos for the time period:

* 25% off new 1-month subs  
* 25% off new 3-month subs  
* 30% off new 6-month subs

The additional points will be added to the point value for the sub tier for recurring subs purchased during the Subathon

\*\*Twitch is offering this additional promotion:  
“*Bonus Gift Subs: For every five gift subs purchased for a channel, Valorant will add one bonus gift sub\*\*\*. But, be on the lookout, because they’ll also be periodically giving out additional gift subs to support your favorite streamers*.”  
The additional points will be added depending upon the Tier and number of gifted subs from Twitch.   
**EXAMPLE: If someone gifts 5 Tier 1 subs which results in 1 gifted sub from Twitch, the points will work as follows: 5 gifted subs (3000 points) \+ 1 gifted sub (600 points) \+ 100 additional points \= 3700 points.**

Now, for the fun part, the GOALS: **(NOTE FOR ETHAN: I don’t necessarily want this in a table. Can you make it prettier and maybe dynamic? Whenever a goal is accomplished, I’ll highlight it and send you the link and you can maybe add a little video player directly on this page or if that’s too heavy just hyperlink to the highlight page so people can see what they missed)**
